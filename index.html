			<h1>Marty Bauer</h1>

			<h2>Oh hey, thanks for being here</h2>

			<p>I'm currently the Managing Director at <a href="http://ironyardventures.com/" target="_blank">Iron Yard Ventures</a> as well as cofounder of several other fun things, some of which have worked and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awf45u6zrP0" target="_blank">some that have not.</a></p>

			</p>My background rages from starting startups and selling the shit out of the product, to product ops, to corporate finance as well as now investing in startups, web development and my most enjoyable time is spent on many long 1-on-1 walks with my daughter.</p>


			<p>Like many people, I became frustrated not being able to build out product ideas myself. Unlike many people - I chose to do something about it and taught myself to code. This is one of those projects.</p>
